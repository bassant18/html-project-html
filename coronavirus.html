<p>Coronavirus is a family of viruses,</p> 
<p>which can cause the common cold or more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome,</p>
<p> Middle East respiratory syndrome, and the coronavirus disease, COVID-19.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has sickened more than 160 million people globally and claimed the lives of more than 3.3 million people worldwide.</p>  
<p>The United States has the largest number of cases in the world — over 32 million — and more than 586,000 deaths.</p> 
<p>The crisis is deepening in India, where the second wave of infections continues to set new records for the world’s largest one-day rise in new cases,</p>
<p> surpassing 300,000 and hitting a high of more than 414,000 cases May 7.</p>

<p>COVID-19 is a contagious disease that causes mild to severe respiratory symptoms with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.</p>
 <p>It spreads primarily by person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets that become airborne when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.</p>
 <p>It was first identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, China</p>
